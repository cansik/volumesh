## Installation

```
pip install volumesh
```

### Draco Compression
To install the [Google Draco](https://google.github.io/draco/) compression, the [DracoPy](https://github.com/seung-lab/DracoPy) library is required. As it is still under development, we only include it when the [extra](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-setuptools-extras) `draco` is specified.

```
pip install "volumesh[draco]"
```

## Usage

To convert a sequence of OBJ files into a volumesh container use the following command:

```bash
volumesh ./data test.glb
```

First specify the folder where the OBJs are located (`data`) and then the output file (`test.glb`). Use the `--compressed` flag if you have `draco` extras installed and want to compress the container.
The following information is stored in the mesh, if available::

* vertices
* triangle indices
* normals
* vertex-uvs
* textures (png / jpeg)

### Limitations
When Draco compression is enabled, only **vertex** and **triangle** information is stored in the mesh. This is due to the fact that [DracoPy](https://github.com/seung-lab/DracoPy) only supports these two primitives. At the moment we recommend not to use the internal compression, but to convert the sequence to a glb file and convert it later with the [gltf-pipeline](https://github.com/CesiumGS/gltf-pipeline). This gives a much better compression and still contains all the information:

```
gltf-pipeline -i .\sequence.glb -o .\sequence-draco.glb -d
```

### Animation
To use the GLTF animation system to render the meshes in a sequence, it is possible to specify the frame rate (default `24`) and set the animation flag. Volumesh will add an animation track that will fade the objects in and out using the GLTF animation tools.

```
volumesh ./human test.glb --animate --fps 24
```

### Help

```bash
usage: volumesh [-h] [--compressed] [--jpeg-textures]
                [--jpeg-quality JPEG_QUALITY] [--animate] [--fps FPS]
                [-tex TEXTURE_SIZE] [--load-safe]
                input output
